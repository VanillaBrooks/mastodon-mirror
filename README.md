# mastodon-mirror
mirror content from reddit to mastodon accounts

## Problems Solved

This project aims to help produce more high quality content for mastodon that is currently lacking. Many mastodon servers have a very limited amount of original content, so mirroring from reddit pages help mitigate this void

## Progress

This project is a heavy work in progress. These are some of the overall goals of the project
